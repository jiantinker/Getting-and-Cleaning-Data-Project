# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is a final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course
Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Download the Data Set:

Unzip the data sets and then change the R Work Directory to the unzipped folder

### Run the following two commands to generate the tidy data set Tidydata.txt

source("run_analysis.R")

run_analysis()

###The enclosed code book includes further information about the variables and the performed transformations.
